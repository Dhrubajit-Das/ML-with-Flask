This file contains the steps taken for the assignment:

   Backend used       : Flask
   Model used         : SSD (Single shot multibox object detector)
   Image preprocessing: OpenCV

Here i have used a pre-trained model which was trained on 90 different classes.

1. File "ObjectDetector.py":
   This file contains the model which predicts new images.


2. File "app.py": This file contains the flask codes.

3. File "templates/index.html": This file has the html codes for the webpage.

4. Folder model contains the pretained SSD model.


Webpage description:
It is a simple webpage that lets you select the image.. The image is selected by the "Choose file" button and it displays the images as well. 
"Detect object!" button will detect the objects.

And the coordinates of the boxes will be displayed in the command prompt.

Thank you
